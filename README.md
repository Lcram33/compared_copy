# compared_copy
A light program to copy exactly the content of a folder into another one.
It takes into account the existing files, compares and delete the older versions.

The program works by first creating a full report of what will be done, so you can check which file will be deleted/copied and why.
It apply what is stated in the file, so any change commited after or during the scan will not be considered.

This program works in Linux based systems (worked with two 5TB HDD on fedora.
It seems like it would not work on Windows. Any fix or change is welcomed !
